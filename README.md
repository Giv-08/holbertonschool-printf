# Custom Printf Project

- Introduction
This project implements a custom version of the `printf` function in C. The goal is to replicate the behavior of the standard library `printf` function with support for various format specifiers. This project is part of an exercise to understand variadic functions and format string parsing in C.

## Features
- Supports standard format specifiers:
  - `%c` for characters
  - `%s` for strings
  - `%d` and `%i` for integers
  - `%i` for unsigned integers
  - `%%` for printing the `%` character
 
## Usage
To use the custom `printf` function, include the header file and call the function as you would with the standard `printf`.
